# Essential Docker for ASP.NET Core

[![Build status][badge]][branch]

A simple ASP.NET Core project that can be used to demonstrate how you would use Docker containers for your own applications.

Based on the Web Application built in the book ['Essential Docker for ASP.NET Core MVC'][1] by Adam Freeman (Apress, 2017).

I'm using Razor Pages instead of MVC like in the book.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022
- ASP.NET Core 8.0
- Docker Desktop

## Getting started

1. Clone the project.
1. Open the solution file `src\ExampleApp.sln`.
1. Press F5 to start the application.
1. The web browser will be launched and you will see the home page of the application.
