# Essential Docker for ASP.NET Core

A simple ASP.NET Core project that can be used to demonstrate how you would use Docker containers for your own applications.

Based on the Web Application built in the book ['Essential Docker for ASP.NET Core MVC'](http://www.apress.com/9781484227770) by Adam Freeman (Apress, 2017).

I'm using Razor Pages instead of MVC like in the book.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2019
- ASP.NET Core 5.0
- Docker Desktop

## Getting started

1. Clone the project.
1. Open the solution file `ExampleApp.sln` with Visual Studio 2019.
1. Press F5 to start the application.
1. Open your browser and go to <https://localhost:44342>.
